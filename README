This project aims at providing a free version of the Garamond types. It is based mainly on the Cicero size of the specimen, as I want to create a text font.

It is still in a very early stage, and as it is my first complete font project, it might not be usable in the near future.

Currently there is only the Regular, which provides the Latin1 set and some other letters (most composed ones are actually generated by the machine), small caps, ligatures, lining- and oldstyle figures and some alternate forms.

Some letterforms are still really ugly and the whole thing is quite unbalanced, so everything may change—even the name of the project.

Of course I would appreciate help, and, as it comes under the OFL licence, forking is allowed—and welcome.
