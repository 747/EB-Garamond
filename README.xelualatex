Short note about using XeLaTeX and LuaLatex with EB Garamond via fontspec.

EB Garamond fonts are loaded through fontspec with

\setmainfont{EB Garamond}

This will load the appropriate fonts for the actual sizes, currently EBGaramond08* for sizes up to 10pt and EBGaramond12* from 10.1pt onwards.

If you want to stay with one design size, you have to load its regular font and switch off optical sizees:

\setmainfont[OpticalSize=0]{EB Garamond 12 Regular}
